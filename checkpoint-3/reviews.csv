R2SU497KN04DMG,"Before making this purchase, I watched a lot of YouTubers complaining about this product. Initially I was skeptical. But after carefully analysing their context, I understand why they are complaining. The product itself is not bad at all, it's about 10% better than 3060 ti in raster performance, and I would say 15-30% better if DLSS frame gen is supported by the games. The reason why YouTubers and others are complaining is with respect to the price. They priced it same as 3060ti when it was launched, and yet gives small improvement. I was lucky I got this deal at 31k INR, and I knew immediately this is good deal, since the other cards which has similar performance like AMD 6700xt were abut 38k INR. So always keep this in mind when buying GPU. Check out the GPU's competition and try to compare the prices. If you are someone who is planning to upgrade from 3060 ti, I would suggest to wait for next gen cards if possible. Since I am coming from Vanilla GTX 1660, this was a huge improvement for me. Overall very happy with the product.",5.0

RG3QWKIEX4D65,The product was genuine. But the packaging was not really good. It was by luck that the product was not damaged during transit. Anyway i was able to register it on MSI website so the genuinity of the product is not in doubt. I was a bit sceptical of the seller but all went well. Now about the product it is a decent graphics card. Usually 4060 gets a lot of bad mouth but i feel its not fair. It is a good gpu with its power to performance.,4.0
