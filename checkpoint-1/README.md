# Checkpoint 1

I have kept all the files like scratch.ipynb and exploring.ipynb here since I want to highlight all the work that I have done for this project.

Files that contain the actual code are `DataLoader.py` and `utils.py`

Also, the processed data was ~250 MB of JSON data hence I have not uploaded to the repo. But, here's a preview of the data :-
